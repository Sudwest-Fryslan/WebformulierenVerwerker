Communicate between Kodison and Corsa. This configuration transforms incoming Kodison messages and makes them into Corsa requests. The responses are then transformed into messages accepted by Kodison.

This application processes SOAP requests that satisfy a WSDL that has been copied from the predecessor of this bridge. The WSDL is included in this project.
